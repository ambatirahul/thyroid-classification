# thyroid-classification ANN
### Classification of thyroid diseases.

**Definition**
**Thyroid disease** is a medical condition affecting the function of the thyroid gland and the symptoms of the disease vary depending on the type of thyroid disease.

**Problem:** A physician needs to know the demographics suffering from thyroid disease. And find what sector of people can be focussed so that 
they do not get admitted or readmitted.

**Who is it for:** Physicians who want to understand what kind of demographics, medications, etc to consider while treating patients with thyroid disease
 so that the right group of people get the proper care and not to be readmitted for the same.

**Data:** The data is accquired from [UCI ML dataset Thyroid Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thyroid+Disease) and in particular will be focussing on ANN dataset.
[ANN](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/thyroid-disease/ann-Readme) provides the info related to the dataset.

**Modeling approach:** We want to predict the probability of patient suffering from thyroid disease, a supervised classification will be a good candidate to predict and estimate. Also will be using various classification algorithms and pick one which performs the best.

The aim is to build models and estimate the probability of patients suffering from different levels of thyroid disease, using factors like age, sex, thyroxine, medication, etc.

 
**Deliverables:**
1. Code (Jupyter notebook), includes:
	- data retrieval
	- data cleaning, normalizing
	- machine learning models
2. Report on the capstone project
3. Findings and presentaions on the project
